Starting a blog is easy! At least, that's what the army of spammy, bot-created sites littering my "starting a blog" search results tell me. Apparently I can make $4,000/month within a year and over $1M in two. TIL.

I've wanted to start a blog for a long time. I've made myriad attempts do to so over the last 4'ish years, in fact. Now I'm more familiar with the various platforms and static site generators than I ever wanted to be, yet here I sit ... 4'ish years later, finally scribbling out my first post.

If it's so easy (and lucrative!) and I've been nursing the desire to blog, what the dickens took so long?

## Starting a _Blog_ vs. _Starting_ a Blog

Subtle difference. Starting a _blog_ is easy. You can jump on Wordpress.com or Squarespace or any of a million resellers/clones of the two and start writing within minutes. If you wanna feel special, and pay a lot more, you can get started on Ghost equally friction-free. If you want bragging rights you can grab a handy starter kit from Jekyll or Gatsby or NextJS or the plucky new Eleventy and build your own blog from scratch; Netlify makes hosting your impressively over-engineered pile of HTML a snap. Beyond even that, you could roll your own blogging setup and claim bragging rights over those with "built it myself" bragging rights because you _really_ built it yourself.

By the by, that last approach is what I ended up doing and what's powering this post you're (still?) reading right now. I'm using NodeJS and processing my markdown with the Unified ecosystem.

Service-service-service, tech-tech-tech, namedrop-namedrop-namedrop ... fair, getting on with it.

Bragging rights don't create content. After all the time and effort and spinning around _starting_ a blog, I never started blogging. I've written exactly one post in the last 4 years. This one. Big f'n deal that I can smugly cast shade at all the 'Pressers out there blogging on their antiquated pile of jQuery-poisoned, plugin-choked crap. They're at least out there _blogging_.

### Hung Up on Starting

Solving problems and building cool stuff and inventing solutions fuels the software engineer part of me.

My GitHub repos include at lest 8 orphaned blog projects; I found 3 Wordpress cancellations in my email archive, too.

### My Repo Walk of Shame

These are some of the blog attempts I've made over the last 4'ish years. This list isn't comprehensive and some of these repos may be private.
